# Python Project: Data Management with Pandas and SQLAlchemy

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to efficiently manage and analyze data using **Pandas** and **SQLAlchemy**. It provides functionalities to process datasets, interact with SQL databases, and perform advanced data manipulation tasks.

## Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or above
- pip (Python package manager)

## Setting Up the Project

Follow these steps to set up the project in your local environment:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
# Clone the repository using Git
$ git clone <repository-url>

# Navigate to the project directory
$ cd <project-directory>
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
A virtual environment helps isolate project dependencies. Run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment:

#### On Windows
```bash
# Create a virtual environment
$ python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
$ .\venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### On macOS/Linux
```bash
# Create a virtual environment
$ python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Required Packages
After activating the virtual environment, install the necessary Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### If `requirements.txt` is unavailable:
Manually install the required packages:
```bash
# Install pandas and SQLAlchemy
$ pip install pandas sqlalchemy
```

### 4. Verify Installation
Check that the required libraries have been successfully installed:
```bash
$ pip list
```
Ensure that `pandas` and `SQLAlchemy` are listed.

## Running the Project

Run the main Python script to execute the project:
```bash
$ python main.py
```
Replace `main.py` with the name of your projectâ€™s primary script.
